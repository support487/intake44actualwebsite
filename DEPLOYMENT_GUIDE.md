# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide for intake44.com

Your site is **ready to deploy**! Since the Vercel CLI requires interactive authentication, here's how to get your site live:

## Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Choose "Import Git Repository" 
4. Navigate to `/Users/alanjames/Documents/intake44/intake44/`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Drag & Drop Deploy
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Drag the entire `intake44` folder to the upload area
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy

## After Deployment

### Configure Custom Domain
1. In your Vercel project dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add `intake44.com` 
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
4. SSL certificate will be auto-generated

### Add Your Images
Don't forget to add these files to `/public/`:
- `intake44_logo.png` (for the navbar)
- `AlanJames.jpeg` (for the about page)

## Project Structure Ready
```
intake44/
â”œâ”€â”€ âœ… All pages built and optimized
